.\This is test of "ifdef"
.\
.\
.\Usage:
.\
.\  .i NAME
.\  ...if NAME is defined...
.\  .s
.\  ...if NAME is not defined...
.\  .f
.\
.\  The value of NAME is arbitrary or even empty.
.\  see .d
.\  see .u
.\
.d TRUE 1
.d FALSE 0
.i TRUE
This is TRUE
.s
This is not TRUE
.f

Whereas...
.i FALSE
As expected, FALSE is also defined! (so FALSE =~= TRUE)
.f

What you want is to .u FALSE
.u FALSE
.i FALSE
NEVER
.s
In this case FALSE is now ... uh ... false.
.f
