= Version 2-series =

This is the current development (on default, trunk, main, master).

The file mk/sys.o.DUMMIES.mk.mk is used during build to prevent gnu make from rebuilding the module-header "sys.o" which announces namespace sys::o.
It is inconvenient that make will rebuild this file using default compilation rules (and fail) thereby destroying other nearby imputed sources.

The tf meta command is added.  It will hook into other subcommands.
Use 'tf list' to see the currently-available subcommands.

A general enfreshening for expected use in (minimally) C++20.
